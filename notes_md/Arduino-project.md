# IML404 // Tangible + Spatial Computing // USC MA+P S20   

## ARDUINO PROJECT // DUE 05/11/2020 @430PM
in short, you can use any combo of 
- 1 input (aka a sensor: ultrasonic, temperature, photo resistor, joystick, button, switch, potentiometer), and 
- 1 output (aka an actuator: a motor, LED, LCD display panel, buzzer, speaker) 
from your kits to build an artwork, device, and/or prototype + your arduino and breadboard.Â  
_if you would like to use more than 1 sensor or actuator, please let me know about your idea during class or in an email._  

your work can be as fun or serious as you like. please feel free to create a work that doesn't solve a problem at all 
(eg create a work that uses arduino to create a kinetic sculpture)
or try to tackle a design problem and constraints that you've made up (can you create a touch-less interface to your computer). 

there's three components to the project: 
- design the circuit (using a program like tinkercad)
- build the circuit (physically wire things up to your arduino + breadboard) 
- fabricate your prototype (think about the physical form your project takes -- is it in an enclosure? are the components exposed?)

this is a fairly open brief, so feel free to present tangential ideas for projects; however, i would like you to work with at least one of the topics listed above.
     
optionally, you can build on your RGB camera work from [PROCESSING PROJECT 01](https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML404/blob/master/notes_md/processing-project.md), though make sure you've done an additional project's worth of work (let's discuss).

### IN-CLASS DEMO + THINGS TO TURN IN TO THE GOOGLE DRIVE:
- in-class video or web cam demo (feel free to just play your documentation video since we'll all be remote)
- your source code (zipped root folder with all pde files + the _data_ folder: images, shaders, etc)
- a txt document with your work's title and one or two sentences about the project 
- single representative photo / screen capture, ~1920x1080px. if your had many iterations of your project that you liked, you optionally can turn in a folder with multiple images.
- 30s to 2m video documentation... ~720p turned in or posted to vimeo/youtube/similar. feel free to use screen capture (quicktime player... new screen recording) and / or camera footage (e.g. a camera pointed at you and the computer / projection screen). this class isn't about professional documentation and graphics (though feel free to add a title and make your video look nice), it's more about capturing how someone interacts with your work via the camera... though keep in mind that most of the world will probably only see your work through documentation, so make it good! 
- _optional_: WIP (_work in progress_) dev work: sketches or images
- _optional_: in addition to turning work into moodle, if you want to gather all the above material onto a website (personal, github, etc), please feel free to do so! this could be particularly useful if you want to document process on the project. ideally this work will be a nice portfolio piece that you'll be proud to share.
