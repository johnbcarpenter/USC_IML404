## Arduino <--> Processing
You can connect Arduino and Processing via your USB ports -- so it's possible to use one of the sensors (with Processing) that we covered earlier in the course to drive your arduino hardware (as Remi did in [_bloom_ (2019)](https://www.remiwedin.com/bloom)); or vice-versa and use an a sensor connected to your Arduino board to drive a Processing sketch.

I'll provide more of a write up on this, but if you're interested in this approach, please start by visiting [SparkFun's introduction to serial communication between Arduino and Processing](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connecting-arduino-to-processing/all).
